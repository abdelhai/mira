# Mira ☎️ (on Deta)

Mira is a personal contacts manager written by [Linus](https://github.com/thesephist/mira). It is a place for keeping in touch with people.

Mira is designed for quick actions and references to people I've met, and things I want to remember about those people. It looks like this in action:

In particular, in addition to normal contact info you see in every app, Mira is capable of storing a few specific kinds of data I like to remember about people:

- past meetings ("mtg"): where are all the places I've met this person, in which occasion, and what did we talk about that I want to remember?
- last met ("last"): when did we last talk? This is useful when I want to follow up with people I haven't talked to in too long.
- place: what city do they live in? This is useful for remembering to visit people I haven't seen in a while whenever I visit a city for the first time in some time.
- unstructured notes: things like extracurricular or volunteering involvements, event attendance, hobbies, and other extraneous information that's useful to know, but not trivial.

This repo is modified to run on [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/).
